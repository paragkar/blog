We all want to stay healthy. Fortunately, doing so is very easy. If that is so, then why are diseases so rampant? What is making the task (staying disease free) so difficult? The whole idea of this note is to discuss this contradiction. While doing so, we will also talk about the opportunities that exist before us to remain disease free.    

**It is all about the immune system**
We stay disease free only when our immune system is healthy. Once it collapses the body gets infested with all kinds of diseases. Hence, it is important to ensure that the immune system stays properly functional. But how? This we can do by a) managing the environment (external and internal) within which our body functions; b) managing the flow of energy (in our body) within that environment. But why is managing the environment so important? 

**We evolved in a stable environment**
We evolved in a stable environment, and while doing so, our body got tuned to function in that environment. However, in the modern time, new lifestyle and food habits (unheard in the ancient times) are fast altering the environment (both internal and external) - making it difficult for the immune system to stay functional - the fundamental reason of us getting infected with all kinds of diseases. Modern biological science has developed many medicines. These drugs do provide us with a temporary relief, but the process also triggers a lot of side effects. So what do we do to keep ourselves healthy? 

**We should consciously avoid taking medicines**
In this regard, I had described my experience of a seminar organised by Dr Pravin Chordia - a formally qualified medical doctor titled "Medicine Free Life". The whole experience was an eye-opener. In this course, Dr Choridia explained how our lives have become more artificial than ever before - leading to unhealthy practices (processed food, and sedentary habits) - resulting in life-threatening diseases. The impact of this course does not emanate from its conclusions (might appear trivial to some), but from the scientific explanations, anchored around simple and hard-hitting metaphors. But where and how do we register for this course?

**"Medicine Free Life" now has a new venue**
Fortunately for us that "Medicine Free Life" now has a new venue at Sreejan at Barkheda (Sehore Dist) - 50 km from Bhopal. You can find the brochure embedded with registration details as under.
