Since 2010, the spectrum in licensed bands is being assigned through a transparent process of auctions. Therefore, every auction has a reserve price and a market-determined price (emanating out of the auction process). In general, these prices in have increased over the years, and are listed in the table titled “[Actual Price](https://paragkar.wordpress.com/spectrum-pricing/)“.

However, since all auctions did not include all circles. Hence, the market prices for a particular service area can be deemed as those discovered in the last auction. These are listed in the table titled as “[Market Price](https://paragkar.wordpress.com/last-auction/)“.
