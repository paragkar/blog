**The figure below provides the latest map of the 800 MHz band.**

In this map, each row is linked to a specific service area. For example, the first row lays out the spectrum of AP (Andhra Pradesh), and the remaining others link the rest of the 21 licensed service areas (LSA). Also, note that **an individual coloured block is of 1.23 MHz width,** and therefore one will need 4 such blocks to complete a chunk of 5 MHz (more accurately 4.92 MHz, and remaining 80 KHz is compensated by the guard band on both sides of the larger block). To prevent confusion from now on we will refer 1.23 MHz as 1.25 MHz, as the marginal shortfall is made up with that in the guard band. The spectrum of each of the 5 operators is indicated by their individual distinct colour (see the legend above). The spectrum assigned are of three types. **Those marked “L” are liberalized for deployment of any technology (2G,3G,4G), and those marked “U” are possible for use only for 2G deployment.** **The blocks marked as “S” are those that were surrendered by TATA**, and will be available for auction as and when decided by DoT. **The blocks marked as “white” are free/unused spectrum blocks of nonstandard size, serving the purpose of isolating usages between operators (guard band).** The size of these blocks can be calculated by multiplying the numeric number by 30. For example, the size of the block marked as G10 is 10 x 30 = 300 KHz. Similarly, other block sizes can be calculated.

Also, the summary of the 800 MHz spectrum assigned is as follows.
