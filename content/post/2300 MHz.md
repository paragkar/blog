The current assignment is messy and will lead to [interference across the circle borders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBLtv_dyraM&amp;feature=youtu.be). This is depicted in the movie embedded in the link above. Each slide in the frame describes a spectrum block of 2.5 MHz.

The WPC’s Final Order will also lead to interference across borders. For details please read my note titled “[2300 MHz Harmonization: The Final Order](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2300-mhz-harmonization-final-order-parag-kar/)“.
