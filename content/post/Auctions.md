Between 2010 and 2016, six auctions have taken place. This resulted in a total bid price over Rs 3.5 Lakhs Cr. The years during which auctions have happened are listed below.

The summary of the band pricing “[Actual](https://paragkar.wordpress.com/spectrum-pricing/)” (emanating out of every auction) and “[last](https://paragkar.wordpress.com/last-auction/)” (emanating out of most current auction) is also listed for enabling easy reference.

For a detailed analysis of all the past auctions, please refer to my note tilted “[Indian Spectrum Auction: The Key Issues and Learnings](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/indian-spectrum-auction-key-issues-learnings-parag-kar/)”

Also, refer to my note titled [How to Calculate Reserve Prices for Spectrum Auctions,](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-calculate-reserve-prices-spectrum-auctions-parag-kar/) which highlights a new model for calculating reserve prices for future auctions. This model is robust and automatically curates the distortions emanating out of the auction process.
