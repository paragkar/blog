**The figure below provides the latest map of 900 MHz band.**

Each slice is of 200 KHz width. These slices are aggregated into larger blocks assigned to individual operators. **The blocks available for auction is marked with “RED” border.** The quantum available in the individual circle is mentioned in the “violet” box. You can see that only 1 circle (TN) has 5 MHz block. Rest of the spectrum is fragmented. Spectrum assigned to Bharti, Vodafone, Idea and RCOM are liberalised. Rest of the spectrum is un-liberalised.

The quality of 900 MHz can be improved significantly once it is harmonized. In this regard, please refer to my note titled  [Harmonizing 900 MHz Band](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/harmonizing-900-mhz-band-parag-kar/).

Also, the summary of the 900 MHz spectrum assigned is as follows.
