In India spectrum has been assigned to operators in 6 bands for exclusive use (licensed) as listed under.

1. [800 MHz band:](https://paragkar.wordpress.com/800-mhz/) 824 to 844 MHz paired with 869 to 889 MHz.
1. [900 MHz band:](https://paragkar.wordpress.com/900-mhz/) 890 to 915 MHz paired with 935 to 960 MHz.
1. [1800 MHz band:](https://paragkar.wordpress.com/1800-mhz/) 1710 to 1785 MHz paired with 1805 to 1880 MHz.
1. [2100 MHz band:](https://paragkar.wordpress.com/2100-mhz/) 1920 to 1980 MHz paired with 2110 to 2170 MHz.
1. [2300 MHz band:](https://paragkar.wordpress.com/2300-mhz/) 2300 to 2400 MHz (unpaired).
1. [2500 MHz band:](https://paragkar.wordpress.com/2500-mhz/) 2496 to 2690 MHz (unpaired).

To improve the quality of these bands it important that they are harmonization as a continuous process. In this regard, I will like to point you to few articles that I have written in past which provides some insights and execution strategies.
