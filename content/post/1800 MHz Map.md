The blocks available for auction is marked with “RED” border. The quantum available in the individual circle is mentioned in the “violet” box. Each circle is shown here in two rows – the top indicating “liberalized spectrum”, and the bottom “un-liberalized spectrum”. Also, a scale (indicated as dotted blocks) has been provided above each circle for the reader to measure the quantum of spectrum assigned to every operator. Each block marked on the scale is 2 MHz width.

Also, the summary of the 1800 MHz spectrum assigned is as follows.

**a) Total 1800 MHz Spectrum**
